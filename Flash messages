If Flask flash messages work on other machines but not on a specific one, the issue is likely machine-specific rather than a problem with your Flask code. Here are some potential causes and solutions to consider:

### 1. **Browser-Specific Issues (Cookies, Cache, and Privacy Settings)**
   - **Clear Cache and Cookies**: Sometimes, cached files or corrupted cookies can cause unexpected issues. Clear the cache and cookies on the affected machine’s browser.
   - **Check Cookie Settings**: Flask flash messages rely on cookies for sessions. If cookies are disabled, or if your site’s cookies are blocked, flash messages won’t work.
     - Ensure that the browser is set to allow cookies and that there are no privacy settings blocking cookies from your app.
   - **Test in Another Browser**: If possible, try a different browser on the same machine to see if the issue is browser-specific.

### 2. **JavaScript and CSS Interference**
   - **Disable Extensions or Ad Blockers**: Browser extensions or ad blockers (like uBlock Origin or AdBlock Plus) may block or hide certain elements, especially if flash messages are rendered in popups or specific UI elements. Try disabling extensions and reloading the page.
   - **Inspect CSS Styles**: On the affected machine, inspect the HTML elements for the flash messages using the browser's developer tools (F12). Ensure that they aren’t hidden due to CSS (`display: none;` or `visibility: hidden;`), especially if your CSS or JavaScript is being loaded differently on this machine.

### 3. **Cross-Site Tracking or SameSite Cookie Restrictions**
   - **SameSite Cookie Settings**: Some modern browsers have stricter SameSite cookie policies, which might prevent the session cookie from working properly if you’re running the site on a `localhost` or different domain setup.
   - **Cross-Site Tracking Prevention**: Safari, for example, has Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP), which may prevent cookies from being stored if it detects tracking-like behavior. Try temporarily disabling these settings.

### 4. **Session Configuration Issue (Only on That Machine)**
   - **Corrupt Session Data**: If sessions are not being correctly created or retrieved on that machine, the flash messages won’t work. Try clearing out any existing session data for your app.
   - **Check the `SECRET_KEY` Consistency**: If this is an app run on multiple servers, ensure that each environment has the same `SECRET_KEY` setting in Flask to avoid session issues.

### 5. **Firewall or Proxy Settings**
   - **Firewall Blocking Specific Elements**: Firewalls or network configurations can sometimes block specific content, especially if your flash messages are rendered as popups or specific AJAX calls. Check if there is any firewall or proxy configuration that might be affecting web content on this machine.
   - **Check for a VPN or Proxy**: If the affected machine uses a VPN or a proxy, try disabling it temporarily to see if the flash messages work.

### 6. **Different Flask Debug Mode or Configuration on This Machine**
   - **Check if Debug Mode Differs**: If you’re running Flask in development mode on one machine and production mode on another, certain behaviors might differ.
   - **Inspect Console Logs for Errors**: Open the browser console on the affected machine and check if there are any errors or warnings related to the flash message rendering. 

After trying these solutions, you should be able to identify the machine-specific reason for the flash messages not appearing. Let me know if you need help with a particular step!
